### Server

### Cost Estimate
kwh_rate        = 0.10  # Rate in currency_type to calculate cost to run job

##Enabled outputs
heat_enabled = True		# Enable control for heater
heat2_enabled = False	# Enabled control for second heater
cool_enabled = False	# Enable control for cooler (exterior fan, etc.)
air_enabled = False		# Enable control for internal air circulation (interior fan)

### Outputs
gpio_heat = 3  # Switches zero-cross SSR
gpio_cool = 5  # Regulates PWM for 12V DC Blower
gpio_air  = 7   # Switches 0-phase det. SSR

heater_invert = 0 # switches the polarity of the heater control

### Inputs
door_enabled = False	# Enable sensor for door open
gpio_door = 12

### Thermocouple Adapter selection:
#   max31855 - bitbang SPI interface
#   max31855spi - kernel SPI interface
max31865 = 1

### Thermocouple Connection (using bitbang interfaces)
gpio_sensor_cs = 24
gpio_sensor_miso = 21
gpio_sensor_mosi = 19
gpio_sensor_clock = 23

### Thermocouple SPI Connection (using adafrut drivers + kernel SPI interface)
spi_sensor_chip_id = 0

### amount of time, in seconds, to wait between reads of the thermocouple
# This is also the rate of the control loop?
sensor_read_period = 1


# PWM Settings
### Default period of PWM, in seconds
PWM_Period_s = 1

# The period will be extended to meet the demanded duty cycle for DC close to 0 or 100%
# without violating the minimum onoff time, until the period reaches its max, at which point
# the system will go full off or on
# This allows more precise PWM near 0 or 1 without causing rapid relay switching

### Minimum On or Off time, in seconds. 
PWM_MinimumOnOff_s = 1

### Maximum allowed extended period
PWM_PeriodMax_s = 90

# PWM Offset Adjustment 
# For systems with multiple heaters and uneven heating, these factors will adjust the PWM to compensate
# For instance, if heater 1 needs to be on more often than heater 2, make heat1adj positive and heat2adj negative

heat1adj = 0		# heater 1 PWM offset, in percent
heat2adj = 0		# heater 2 PWM offset, in percent

### Profile Adjustments for Kilns
# must_hit_temp adjusts for systems where the heater might not be able to keep up with the profile
# If false, the system will not adjust the timing of the profile
# If true, the system is guaranteed to hit the temperatures of the profile. It will wait until
# the target is reached before moving to the next segment of the profile
must_hit_temp = True

# Cone slope adj adjusts the target temperature when the segment takes longer than expected
# It's expressed in deg C per (deg C per hour), i.e. the shift in temperature target per shift in temperature rate
# For instance, setting to 0.4 will reduce the target temperature by 40 deg C if the final slope is 100 deg C/hour
# lower than the profile slope
# Only used if must_hit_temp is True
cone_slope_adj = 0.4

#the number of cycles the PID autone will complete before setting PID
tune_cycles = 3

#the temperature the autotune will use for calculation of PID
tune_target_temp = 150
